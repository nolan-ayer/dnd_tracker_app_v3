This project is a demonstration of using asynchronous javascript to enable CRUD functionality.

This application includes user authentication, password changes, modifiable player cards, and game notes.

DEV TODOS

useEffect to fetch "fixes coming soon" from backend

update styling to be less bland and simple
change background color to fit new aesthetic
redo header style

fix form bug that triggers error modal when using keyboard to submit creation of new card

add edit functionality to notes

redo styling for note titles to keep delete button (and eventually edit button) in its place - line break the title
